- Christian Cagnoni

In this project, K-Means and DB-SCAN algorithms has been implemented. For both of them 3 version has been compared: serial, parallel on CUDA and parallel on CPU (OpenMP).

This was an university project, the aim was to practice parallel computing and related tools like CUDA and OpenMP.
