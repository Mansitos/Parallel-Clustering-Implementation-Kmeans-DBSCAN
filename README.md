# Parallel-Clustering-Implementation-Kmeans-DBSCAN

Universit√† degli Studi di Udine - 2021
- Mansi Andrea
- Christian Cagnoni

In this project, K-Means and DB-SCAN algorithms have been implemented. 3 version have been compared (for both of them): serial, parallel on CUDA and parallel on CPU (via OpenMP).

This is an university project, the aim was to practice parallel computing/programming model and related tools like CUDA and OpenMP.

A PDF report is included. Make file is included.
